    "abstract": "Global environmental change encompasses significant alterations in Earth's systems due to natural processes and human activities. Key physical processes include the greenhouse effect, atmospheric and oceanic circulation, the hydrological and carbon cycles, and cryosphere dynamics. Human-induced activities, such as deforestation, fossil fuel combustion, and urbanization, intensify these changes, disrupting ecosystems and climate patterns. Consequences include rising temperatures, sea-level rise, biodiversity loss, and more frequent extreme weather events. Understanding these interconnected processes is essential for developing effective mitigation strategies to ensure environmental sustainability. The role of advancements in renewable energy technologies, including solar power, wind energy, and nuclear fusion, will be examined.",

    "abstract": "This presentation starts by overviewing experimental measurement techniques in physics, with particular emphasis on the introduction of instrumentation concepts such as instrument sensitivity, accuracy and resolution, the knowledge of which is essential for reliable data acquisition. After surveying fundamental measurement approaches, including low-level current measurements and quantum transport characterisation, we will focus on impedance spectroscopy, which is a versatile technique applicable across physics, chemistry, and biology. This will pave the way for elaborating the discussion on the interesting non-invasive, contamination-free method of contactless impedance spectroscopy. The discussion will show means for extracting and analyzing frequency- and temperature-dependent dielectric properties using a contactless measurement setup where electrodes are capacitively coupled to liquid samples through capillary tube walls. Key instrumentation concepts, including sensitivity, accuracy, and signal-to-noise considerations, will be applied to assess measurement suitability based on sample polarization properties and tube wall capacitance. Executing these measurements via the Keysight impedance analyzers will also be illustrated. The emphasis on impedance spectroscopy stems from its broad applicability across scientific disciplines and its ability to reveal rich biophysical and physical chemistry information through electrical relaxation phenomena. This technique exemplifies how a proper understanding of instrument limitations and measurement physics enables the extraction of fundamental material properties from complex experimental data.",
